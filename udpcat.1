.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B udpcat
reads lines of hex dumps from
.I stdin
and writes them as UDP datagrams, one per input line.
It also listens to responses and complains if some datagram is
not echoed verbatim (it assumes it's talking to a service similar
to the UDP
.B echo
service traditionally available on port 7).
.
.PP
It's vaguely similar to
.BR "nc \-u \fIhost port" ,
except:
.IP \- 3x
Input is a hex dump so it's easy to send binary payload.
.IP \-
Udpcat verifies responses; netcat echoes them.
.
.PP
Like you'd expect, there is IPv6 support, and you can
use host and service names for
.I host
and
.IR port ,
not just numerical addresses and port numbers.
.
.PP
.B ipcat
is similar, but lets you send raw IPv4 datagrams carrying
.I protocol
instead. I.e. the hex dump lines provided as input becomes
IPv4 payload rather than UDP payload.
IPv6 is not supported here.
.PP
The
.I protocol
may be given numerically or as a protocol name, e.g.
.BR udp ,
.BR icmp ,
.BR sctp .
.
.SS "Input syntax"
The input is simply lines of hex dumps.  You may use any amount
of whitespace between octets to increase readability;
.IR "1234f0" ,
.I "1234\~f0"
and
.I "12\~34\~f0"
mean the same thing.
.PP
Parse errors are detected and reported.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.BP "\-d\ \fIN"
Send every datagram duplicated
.I N
times. Bursts of at most 100 datagrams will be sent; then
udpcat will stop to collect responses for at most 0.5 seconds
before continuing.
.
.BP "--connect"
.BR connect (2)
the socket to the destination.  This may help performance
and let you detect more errors like
.IR "host unreachable" .
It might also enable PMTU discovery and prevent IP fragmentation.
.
.BP "--ip-option"
Send a dummy IPv4 option with every packet, just to see what happens.
.
.BP "\-s\ \fIsource"
Bind to a local address which will become the source address
for the datagrams.
